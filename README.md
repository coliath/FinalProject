## Resource Root

### Overview

Resource Root is an in browser E-reader with highlighting and social tools.

The goal is to build an E-reader that supports groups of people reading the same text.

When people read together, everyone can benefit from shared ideas and alternate viewpoints.

Also, writers are able to gain valuable insight into how readers consume the their content.  Writers learn what readers find helpful, what they find confusing, as well as any errors they may spot.

Resource Root is about **reading, writing and learning, better, together.**

### Tech Stack

I want Resource Root emulate a native application as much as possible.

With this in mind, I made heavy use of Ajax, and front end MV-*.

The front end technologies are as followsâ€¦
* Javascript
* Backbone.js
* Underscore.js
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* CSS/SASS
* HTML

And the backend is a Ruby on Rails application with PostgreSQL as the data store.
